- Procedural programming, also called imperative or structural programming
- Break the logic into procedures(FUNCTIONS,ROUTINES,SUBROUTINES)
- Program state is typically held in variables, and you pass data often via arguments.
- Manipulate the state inside procedures.
- Control flow (loops, conditionals, calls) is explicit.
- It emphasizes “do these steps in order, call this function to do a sub-task, return result, continue”.
- Can be difficult to scale
- Lead to spaghetti code (diorganized and hard-to-maintain)
